🏌️ # PGA Tour Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing PGA Tour data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The dataset includes various performance metrics and player stats, with additional insights gathered through web scraping (not included in this notebook).

📁 ## Project Structure
PGA Tour - EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the initial EDA.

data/: (Not included here) Assumed directory for storing raw and processed data.

scripts/: (Optional) Web scraping and data processing scripts.

README.md: Project documentation (you’re reading it!).

🔍 ## Objectives
Perform detailed EDA on PGA Tour player statistics.

Identify performance trends, key metrics, and player comparisons.

Integrate scraped data to enhance insights (e.g., player bios, course stats, recent performances).

📊 ## Key Highlights
Overview of player stats (e.g., driving distance, putting, scoring average).

Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between performance indicators.

Visualizations for data-driven storytelling (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps).

Foundation for building predictive models or dashboards (in future phases).

🛠️ ## Tools & Libraries
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Web scraping with requests, BeautifulSoup, and potentially Selenium (scripts not included here)

📌 ## Future Work
Include complete web scraping pipeline.

Add interactive visualizations using Plotly or Streamlit.

Build a dashboard or prediction model based on performance trends.

🧠 ## Insights (so far)
[Insert one or two quick bullets from your EDA results — e.g., “Driving Accuracy has a weak correlation with scoring average.”]
